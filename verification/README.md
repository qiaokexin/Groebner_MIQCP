# Verification

The files in this folder construct equations using the outputs of our constructed Griffin, Anemoi, and CinimionMIQCP models, respectively, and verify that the model outputs satisfy the CICO problem by bringing the solutions of the equations into the wheel function. The file with the .mag extension is the derived system of equations.
