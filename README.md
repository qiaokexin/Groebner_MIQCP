[Gurobi]: https://www.gurobi.com/

This is the source codes for submitted paper "Programming Equation Systems of Arithmetization-Oriented Primitives with Constraints".  Preinstallation is [Gurobi]. This work is done by version 9.5.

The file util4Groebner.py provides the functions for generating variables groups and for generating constraints for all arithmetic modules and branching modules. The other five files are the codes for building and solving MIQCP models for Griffin (with 3-branches), Griffin (with 4-branches), Griffin (with 8-branches), Anemoi, and Ciminion.
The pdf Griffin_other_versions.pdf is the result of other versions of Griffin.
